# Introduction
##############
# This script generates gazebo models for black and white checkerboards for use
# in visual detection or calibration. The checkerboards are pure black and white
# with a white border, which allows them to be used with systems such as
# OpenCV's chessboard detectors.
# 
# This script could also be used as a jumping-off point to create an automatic
# AR tag generator.
#
# Usage
#######
# The following command will generate a new folder and populate it with a Gazebo
# model.
#
# generate_checkerboard.py rows columns [square_size_in_meters]
#
# This folder can be placed anywhere in your Gazebo models path, such as the 
# default location: $HOME/.gazebo/models.
